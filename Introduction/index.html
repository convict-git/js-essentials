               my_variable defined in script was explicitly exported and then imported by oscript, which in turn logged its value. </br>
               But, my_variable isn't available in the global space as the object was defined in a module. </br>
               Unlike my_variable, my_proud_variable sits in main js file (and not a module), and is available in the global namespace.
