# Variables

- Nothing clever. Just use `let`, `var` and `const` smartly. Take care of scopes.
- Preincrement, postincrement works similar to C/C++
- `+` is overloaded for string concatentaion while other operators don't make sense on strings. So don't complain on why `12 + "4" = 124` and `12 - "4" = 8`. (It's not stupid and it makes complete sense!)
- `=` is for assignment, `==` is for checking equivalence, and `===` also checks for equivalence but requires the datatype to be equal as well. i.e. `4 == "4"` is `true` but `4 === "4"` is Not.

# Arrays
